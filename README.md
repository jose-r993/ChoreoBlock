Traditional Ballet Folklórico choreography planning involves drawing circles on notebooks to represent dancers, with arrows showing movement between positions. ChoreoBlock digitizes and enhances this process, allowing choreographers to:

- Visualize formations in real-time
- Precisely time transitions to music beats
- Share choreography digitally with dancers
- Make adjustments more efficiently

By streamlining the choreography creation process, ChoreoBlock helps instructors communicate formations more effectively to dancers, saving time during rehearsals.

## Features

- **Formation Management**: Create and edit dancer formations on a virtual stage
- **Music Synchronization**: Align choreography with music beats and timestamps
- **Transition Paths**: Define custom movement paths for dancers between formations
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize and navigate through choreography with an interactive waveform display
- **Grouping System**: Organize formations into logical groups for easier management
- **Path Animation**: Preview dancer movements with smooth path animations

## Future Plans

- Local saving with IndexedDB that keeps track of all data for a project
- Integration with custom beat tapping for user adjustment of BPM
- Account creation to let users create projects for each blocked song
- Mobile web app for dancers to view their positions/paths
